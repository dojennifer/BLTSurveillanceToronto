      <description>Jennifer Do 2020-09-27   Abstract Blacklegged Tick Surveillance in Toronto monitors the number of ticks and positive cases of Lyme disease within the city. Here, we explore the Toronto Blacklegged Tick Surveillance dataset from 2013 to 2019. We find that higher numbers of Blacklegged Ticks (BLTs) correspond to higher cases of Lyme disease, particularly around Rouge Park and its associated trails. From our findings, we are able to determine that though rates of tick prevalence and positive cases of Lyme disease have decreased since 2017, areas around Rouge Park have higher likelihoods to exposure to BLTs.</description>
